    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at Paris Observatory. My study is about identifying astronomical signals from cyclostratigraphic depth series.
    My recent research was centered on reconstructing Earth's axial precession frequency evolution to better understand the astronomical influences on Earth
    system processes, with a particular focus on tidal effects on Earth's interior and surface. I aimed to combine geological evidence with tidal simulation models
    to gain deeper insights into the evolution of Earth's systems and their connection to broader Solar System dynamics. Throughout my Ph.D. research, I focused on
    exploring the evolution of Earth's crust, major geological events, and the periodicity within Earth's systems through time-series analysis of zircon U-Pb geochronology data.
    I was dedicated to big earth data and geological data analysis because the integrated analysis of widely distributed geological records yields important information
    about the earth system that cannot be obtained by studying these records individually.
